textComparer
============

Compares an old and new text to display the paragraphs that were already present in the old one. It's also fault tolerant, so if a paragraph has minimal changes it is able to recognize it anyway. 


Compiling
============
You need to download QtCreator with Qt(5.2 or above). Than open ComparaAnnunci.pro with QtCreator and build it.
